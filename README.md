## 🧰 Tech Stack:

- React & React Query
- Tanstack Query - A library that helps with sending HTTP requests & keeping the frontend in sync.
- JavaScript
- CSS3
- ViteJS
- NodeJS
- ExpressJS

## 🛠️ Techniques:

- **`Tanstack/React Query`**:
  - **_useQuery_**: Is a hook that used to send an API request and handle the result of that request.
  - **_QueryClient_**: Is the core instance for managing caching, fetching, synchronizing, and updating server data. It configures global settings, handles queries/mutations, and manages their states and lifecycle events across the app.
  - **_QueryClientProvider_**: Is a component that provides a **QueryClient** to our React application. It enables React components to use hooks like **useQuery** and **useMutation** for data fetching, caching, synchronization, and state management. It must wrap your app to function.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
